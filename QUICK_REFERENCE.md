## üîç Quick Decision Matrix

### Should I migrate to v2?

| If you... | Then... |
|-----------|---------|
| Process large datasets | ‚úÖ YES - 3-4x faster |
| Need better performance | ‚úÖ YES - Significant gains |
| Want fewer dependencies | ‚úÖ YES - 33% reduction |
| Need async support | ‚úÖ YES - True async |
| Happy with current v1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE - But v1 has stability issues |
| Have tight timeline | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE - But only 7-11 days needed |
| Can't break API | ‚ùå NO - Breaking changes (but easy migration) |

### Should I fix v1 issues first?

| Issue | Fix Now? | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|
| No timeout | ‚úÖ YES | 15 min |
| Inconsistent errors | ‚úÖ YES | 30 min |
| Double progress bar | ‚úÖ YES | 5 min |
| Module semaphore | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE | 15 min |
| Others | ‚è≥ LATER | Various |

**Total effort for critical fixes:** 2-3 hours
