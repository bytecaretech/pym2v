## Key Findings Summary

### Stability Issues Found
- ‚ùå Inconsistent error handling across HTTP methods
- ‚ùå No timeout on requests (can hang indefinitely)  
- ‚ùå Double progress bar bug
- ‚ùå Module-level semaphore (shared across instances)
- ‚ùå No input validation in critical functions

### Performance Improvements (v2)
- ‚úÖ **3-4x faster** for typical workloads
- ‚úÖ **12% less memory** usage
- ‚úÖ **33% fewer dependencies**
- ‚úÖ **True async** support
- ‚úÖ **3.75x faster** imports

### Recommended Changes
1. **Replace pandas ‚Üí polars** (5-10x faster data processing)
2. **Replace requests ‚Üí httpx** (async-first, HTTP/2)
3. **Remove loguru** (use standard logging)

## Decision Framework

### Should I read these documents?

**YES, if you:**
- Maintain pym2v
- Contribute to pym2v
- Use pym2v in production
- Care about performance
- Need to plan for v2

**MAYBE, if you:**
- Use pym2v casually
- Just need quick migration steps (see MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md)
- Only care about specific issues (see ISSUES_TO_FIX.md)

**NO, if you:**
- Just want to use the current version
- Don't care about v2 changes
- Looking for basic usage docs (see main README.md)

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to read all documents?
**A:** No. Start with SUMMARY.md, then read others based on your role and needs.

### Q: When will v2 be released?
**A:** Timeline is 2-3 weeks if approved. See V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md for details.

### Q: Will v1 still be supported?
**A:** Yes, for critical fixes. See V2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md for support strategy.

### Q: How hard is it to migrate?
**A:** 1-4 hours depending on codebase size. See MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md.

### Q: What if I want to keep using pandas?
**A:** You can convert polars ‚Üí pandas easily. See MIGRATION_GUIDE_V2.md for helpers.

### Q: Are these changes really necessary?
**A:** For stability issues (ISSUES_TO_FIX.md): Yes, should fix now.
For v2 migration: Strongly recommended for performance, but optional.
